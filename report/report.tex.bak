\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The rapid evolution of deep learning has transformed medical image analysis, enabling unrivaled accuracy in tasks such as brain tumor segmentation. However, these advances have come at the cost of ever evolving increase in model complexity, size and computational demands, which pose significant barriers to real-world clinical deployment especially in resource constrained devices \cite{Yang2025, Mazurek2024, Wu2023, Ragab2024}. > In brain tumor segmentation, there is a strong demand for computationally efficient models. High-resolution, multi-modal MRI scans remain the standard for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, but analyzing such data requires models capable of handling large volumes quickly and with high precision. In clinical settings manual segmentation is labor-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability, while traditional deep neural networks, though powerful, often require substantial computational resources that are not always available in clinical or edge environments \cite{Yang2025, Ragab2024}.

Within this landscape, the RAAGR2-Net (Recurrent Attention Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling R2 Network) has emerged as a sophisticated architecture tailored for brain tumor medical image segmentation \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}. RAAGR2-Net integrates recurrent modules (R2) for iterative feature refinement, attention mechanisms to selectively enhance relevant anatomical structures, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale contextual information. These components enables RAAGR2-Net to delineate complex tumor boundaries with high fidelity, addressing the unique challenges posed by heterogeneous and infiltrative brain tumors. However, these architectural innovations come with a significant computational cost: the model's depth, recurrent connections, and attention modules result in high parameter counts and memory requirements, making RAAGR2-Net computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained clinical settings \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2, Wang2023Review, Mazurek2024}.

The architectural design of RAAGR2-Net follows a progressive channel expansion in the encoder path (typically input→64→128→256) with a symmetrical decoder structure. This configuration enables the network to capture both fine-grained details and broad contextual information critical for precise tumor delineation. The recurrent residual blocks (R2) enhance feature representation through iterative refinement, while attention gates selectively focus on relevant anatomical regions, improving the model's ability to distinguish tumor boundaries from surrounding tissues. The dilated-convolutional spatial pyramid pooling module (ReASPP3) facilitates multi-scale feature aggregation without excessive computational overhead, addressing the critical challenge of capturing context at various resolutions \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}.

A persistent gap exists between state-of-the-art segmentation performance in research settings and practical deployment requirements in clinical environments. Despite RAAGR2-Net's excellent tumor delineation capabilities, its high memory and computational demands present significant barriers to deployment in settings with limited GPU availability, strict latency requirements, and constrained power budgets—conditions commonly encountered in clinical and edge computing scenarios \cite{Yang2025, Mazurek2024}. These constraints are particularly evident in healthcare facilities with limited resources, mobile diagnostic units, and point-of-care devices, where hardware must be compact, energy-efficient, and capable of real-time inference.

Furthermore, local deployment is often a critical requirement in clinical environments to ensure patient data privacy and to comply with healthcare regulations. However, the substantial computational needs of RAAGR2-Net complicate secure on-premise deployment, potentially forcing reliance on cloud solutions that may introduce additional security and privacy concerns.

The need for efficient, lightweight models is underscored by the increasing demand for real-time, on-device inference in medical imaging applications. As healthcare systems strive to integrate AI tools into routine clinical workflows, the ability to deploy advanced segmentation models on affordable hardware becomes paramount. This is particularly relevant in low-resource settings, where access to high-performance computing infrastructure may be limited \cite{Yang2025, Mazurek2024}.

The economic and clinical benefits of model compression are substantial. Pruning and weight-sharing techniques can significantly reduce inference time and memory footprint, enabling deployment on affordable, compact hardware. This not only lowers equipment costs but also facilitates the integration of AI tools across a wider spectrum of healthcare facilities, including those in resource-limited regions \cite{Wu2023, Ragab2024}. By democratizing access to advanced segmentation tools, compressed models can improve diagnostic equity and enhance scalability of AI-driven healthcare worldwide.

This tension between accuracy and efficiency is at the heart of current research in medical AI. While RAAGR2-Net and similar architectures deliver strong segmentation results, their complexity limits their practical utility. In real-world healthcare, there is a pressing need for models that are not only accurate but also lightweight, fast, and energy-efficient \cite{Mazurek2024, Wu2023}.Model compression techniques—such as pruning (both structured and unstructured), knowledge distillation, and quantization—offer promising solutions for reducing model size, accelerating inference, and lowering energy consumption, all while striving to maintain high segmentation accuracy \cite{Mazurek2024, Wu2023, Jeong2021}. In this work, I extend these efforts by investigating novel parameter sharing strategies, including shared kernel weights, encoder-decoder shared weights and pairwise shared blocks, to further enhance model efficiency and compactness. While parameter sharing is a well-known technique in deep learning, my approach explores new configurations designed specifically for efficient medical image segmentation.

Despite the growing body of work on model compression in general-purpose neural networks, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding systematic evaluations of pruning and parameter sharing specifically for specialized, recurrent-attention architectures like RAAGR2-Net in medical imaging. Most existing studies focus on standard CNNs or transformer models, leaving the unique interactions between compression methods and the complex modules of RAAGR2-Net largely unexplored \cite{Mazurek2024, Jeong2021}. This gap is significant, as the practical deployment of advanced segmentation models in clinical environments depends on our ability to optimize them for efficiency without sacrificing diagnostic performance.

The primary objective of this research is to rigorously test and benchmark a range of pruning (structured and unstructured) and parameter sharing techniques on RAAGR2-Net, with the goal of producing slim, high-performing models suitable for real-time clinical deployment. While systematically evaluating the trade-offs between model size, computational efficiency, and segmentation accuracy, this work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, scalable solutions for brain tumor segmentation in healthcare.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation and Novel Insights}

This research introduces a \textbf{paradigm-shifting perspective} on neural network compression by conceptualizing it not merely as a post-training optimization but as a fundamental architectural design principle that can enhance both efficiency and generalization. Our novel theoretical framework posits that the traditional view of compression as a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency is fundamentally flawed when applied to medical imaging architectures with inherent redundancies.

\textbf{The Compression-Generalization Hypothesis:} We propose that strategic parameter sharing in complex medical segmentation architectures can act as a form of \textit{architectural regularization} that forces the network to learn more generalizable, fundamental visual primitives rather than dataset-specific patterns. This hypothesis challenges the conventional wisdom that more parameters necessarily lead to better performance, particularly in the context of medical imaging where overfitting to training data can compromise real-world clinical performance.

\textbf{The Architectural Efficiency Principle:} Unlike conventional pruning approaches that operate on trained networks, our research demonstrates that \textit{compression-aware architectural design} can achieve superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. This principle suggests that the optimal path to efficient neural networks lies not in removing components from overparameterized models, but in designing architectures that are inherently efficient while maintaining expressive capacity.

\textbf{The Clinical Deployment Imperative:} Our analysis reveals that the deployment requirements of medical AI systems create unique constraints that are fundamentally different from those in general computer vision. Specifically, the need for consistent performance across diverse patient populations, regulatory compliance, and interpretability requirements necessitate compression strategies that preserve not just overall accuracy but also class-specific performance stability. This insight drives our focus on architectural modifications over traditional pruning techniques.

These theoretical contributions provide the foundation for our empirical investigations and distinguish this work from conventional model compression studies by establishing a comprehensive framework for understanding efficiency in medical AI systems.

\section{Literature Review and Related Works}
\label{sec:literature}

\subsection{Neural Network Pruning Approaches}
\label{subsec:pruning}
Neural network pruning has become a cornerstone technique for compressing deep models to make them deployable in resource-constrained environments. At its core, pruning strategies are broadly categorized into \textbf{unstructured} and \textbf{structured} approaches, each carrying distinct theoretical and practical trade-offs.

The concept of \textit{unstructured pruning} originates from the early work of \cite{LeCun1990Optimal}, and was later advanced by magnitude-based techniques like those introduced by \cite{Han2015Learning}. This method involves removing individual weights based on certain criteria (typically magnitude), resulting in sparse but irregular model connectivity. Such methods have demonstrated the potential to reduce parameter counts by over 90\% in classification tasks with minimal accuracy degradation \cite{Han2015deep, Frankle2019Lottery}.

% TODO: Add figure showing comparison of dense vs sparse network architectures
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Comparison between unpruned and pruned neural networks. Left: Visualization of an unpruned network with full connectivity versus a pruned network with selective connections removed. Right: Detailed visualization of filter-level pruning mechanics showing original filter values, binary mask application, and the resulting pruned filters. The pruning process creates sparse structures while preserving essential connections. Adapted from "A Survey on Deep Neural Network Pruning: Taxonomy, Comparison, Analysis, and Recommendations" \cite{Cheng2024}.}
\label{fig:pruning_types}
\end{figure}

Unstructured pruning brought attention to the compelling "lottery ticket hypothesis," which suggests that certain subnetworks within highly overparameterized models can achieve performance comparable to the full model, provided they are initialized correctly \cite{Frankle2019Lottery}

However since modern accelerators and inference engines are not optimized for irregular sparsity patterns, it yields insignificant gains in real-world inference speed \cite{Gale2020Sparse} Notably, \cite{He2017Channel} observed that irregular sparsity can even hamper hardware parallelism, underlining the limited applicability of this approach outside research prototypes.

Unstructured pruning, in contrast, operates at the granularity of individual weights, producing sparse connectivity patterns. This method eliminates individual weights, creating sparse tensors that require specialized libraries for efficient execution. Magnitude-based pruning, a canonical unstructured method, eliminates weights whose absolute values fall below a predefined threshold, ranking filters or weights by their L₁ or L₂ norms. Despite the challenges magnitude-based pruning remains widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in iterative pruning schemes \cite{Liu2023Survey, Wu2023}.

While unstructured pruning has been reported to maintain high accuracy in large-scale models \cite{Gale2020Sparse}, its efficacy in architectures with extensive skip connections and attention mechanisms, such as UNet and RAAGR2-Net, requires careful evaluation. In our experiments (see Section \ref{sec:results}), unstructured pruning methods demonstrate a stark performance dichotomy: without fine-tuning, they exhibit substantial performance degradation, while with proper fine-tuning protocols, they can recover near-baseline performance. This finding underscores the critical importance of post-pruning recovery training in complex medical segmentation architectures, contrasting with structured and architectural modification approaches that maintain performance without requiring additional training phases.

Structured pruning targets entire architectural components—such as neurons, filters, or channels—thereby streamlining computational operations and facilitating real-world acceleration on modern hardware. This approach removes whole filters or channels, resulting in models that are more amenable to hardware acceleration and parallelization \cite{Liu2023Survey, Mazurek2024}. For instance, network slimming a form of structured pruning applies L1 regularization to the scaling factors of batch normalization layers, identifying and removing less important channels. This approach not only reduces model size but also yields tangible speedups during inference, making it particularly attractive for clinical deployment \cite{Liu2023Survey, Mazurek2024}.

However, structured pruning is not without drawbacks. Complex architectures with skip connections or attention mechanisms can suffer from accuracy degradation when pruned too aggressively. For instance, \cite{Guo2022Dependency} observed that removing entire structures may disrupt information flow, particularly in architectures like UNet.

This research explores three pruning techniques for deep neural networks: two unstructured methods—magnitude-based pruning and SNIP (Single-shot Network Pruning based on Connection Sensitivity) as well as one structured method, DepGraph pruning.

Magnitude-based and SNIP pruning are widely adopted unstructured approaches that target individual weights for removal, allowing for fine-grained sparsity and minimal accuracy loss under certain conditions. DepGraph, on the other hand, is a structure-aware pruning technique that identifies and remove uneccessary parameters by analyzing the structural dependencies between layers and connections. This method is particularly effective in complex architectures like RAAGR2-Net, where interdependencies can significantly impact performance \cite{ Cai2022Dependency}.

These techniques were selected to provide a representative comparison between classic and state-of-the-art unstructured strategies (magnitude-based and SNIP) and a modern structured approach (DepGraph), highlighting their respective advantages and trade-offs in the context of neural network compression.

SNIP (Single-shot Network Pruning) introduces a paradigm shift by evaluating the sensitivity of each connection to the loss function at initialization. This enables the identification and removal of less critical weights before training begins. By pruning connections based on gradient saliency, SNIP minimizes the need for additional hyperparameter tuning and retraining—a significant advantage in resource-constrained domains such as medical imaging, where computational resources and labeled data may be limited \cite{Lee2019SNIP, Liu2023Survey}.

\caption{SNIP (Single-shot Network Pruning) algorithm workflow. The process evaluates connection sensitivity at initialization using a single forward pass, enabling pruning before training begins. Connection sensitivity measures the impact each weight would have on the loss if removed. By keeping only the most important connections, SNIP significantly reduces computational costs compared to train-then-prune methods. Adapted from \cite{Lee2019SNIP}.}
\label{fig:snip_workflow}
\end{figure}

Dependency graph pruning represents a more holistic strategy, analyzing the interdependencies among network components to achieve optimal compression while preserving structural integrity. This method constructs a graph of layer dependencies, enabling holistic pruning that maintains structural consistency across complex architectures like RAAGR2-Net. Recent advances have shown that such methods can yield highly compressed models with negligible performance degradation, a property of immense value in medical imaging applications where accuracy is paramount \cite{Mazurek2024, Ragab2024}.

The selection of pruning techniques in this study was guided by their fundamentally different approaches to parameter removal. Magnitude-based pruning is a post-training, weight-dependent technique, targeting weights that are small in magnitude after full training. In contrast, SNIP and DepGraph represent approaches that do not rely on trained weight values: SNIP evaluates connection importance based on their sensitivity to loss at initialization, while DepGraph leverages the computational structure or dependency graph of the network. By comparing these diverse strategies, this work aims to provide a holistic view of both structure-based and weight-based pruning efficacy across different operational timings.

\subsection{Parameter Sharing Strategies}

Parameter sharing aims to reduce redundancy by reusing weights across different parts of a neural network, thereby reducing the overall parameter count and computational requirements. This approach must be implemented carefully to minimize accuracy degradation despite the substantial reduction in model size \cite{desai2024}.

\subsubsection{Foundations and Evolution}

The fundamental concept of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) itself embodies parameter sharing, as identical filters are applied across different spatial locations of an image. This inherent weight reuse significantly reduces parameters compared to fully connected networks, enabling CNNs to generalize effectively across diverse visual tasks \cite{Krizhevsky2012ImageNet}. Beyond this foundational form, researchers have developed increasingly sophisticated parameter sharing strategies to further enhance model efficiency.

Early attempts at more extensive parameter sharing revealed that naive implementations could lead to training instability and poor convergence \cite{jeong2021}. However, recent approaches have introduced nuanced sharing schemes that avoid these pitfalls. For instance, Structured Channel Weight Sharing (SCWC) clusters channels so that multiple feature maps utilize the same filter weights. This "soft sharing" achieved remarkable compression: approximately 50\% parameter reduction in ResNet-50 with only a 0.13\% top-1 accuracy drop, and 70\% fewer parameters in VGG16 with a 1.64\% drop on ImageNet \cite{li2022}.

\subsubsection{Applications in Large Models}

Parameter sharing techniques have proven particularly valuable in large Transformer and language models to address their massive scale. The ALBERT model \cite{lan2020} represents a seminal example where all layers of a 12-layer Transformer share a single set of parameters. By combining this with embedding factorization, ALBERT-base reduced BERT-base from 110M to approximately 12M parameters with only minor accuracy degradation on NLP tasks. Notably, ALBERT-large (18M parameters) achieved performance comparable to BERT-large (334M parameters) on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks—representing an 18$\times$ parameter reduction for similar results \cite{lan2020}.

In mobile computing contexts, MobileNet's strategic use of shared depthwise filters enabled real-time inference on smartphones by dramatically reducing computational demands \cite{howard2017, sandler2018}. In medical imaging, Nguyen et al. demonstrated that their U-Lite model—employing strategic parameter sharing—achieved a 35$\times$ reduction in size compared to U-Net while maintaining or even improving Dice scores, likely due to the regularization effects of shared parameters \cite{nguyen2023}.

\subsubsection{Encoder-Decoder Weight Sharing}

Encoder-decoder weight sharing represents a specialized technique where identical parameters serve both encoder and decoder components in neural architectures. This approach ranges from simple tied embeddings in NLP models to complete model-level sharing where entire networks mirror each other.

The Tied Transformer by Xia et al. exemplifies this strategy, utilizing identical weights for all encoder and decoder layers while maintaining translation quality comparable to standard untied models despite reducing parameters by approximately half \cite{xia2019}. This architectural constraint forces both components to operate in a common representational space, with the decoder essentially functioning as an identical copy of the encoder with appropriate masking for autoregressive generation.

The theoretical foundation for weight sharing rests on principles that make this constraint advantageous rather than limiting. Since encoder-decoder architectures function similarly to autoencoders, they benefit from learning compact and reversible representations. Kim et al. demonstrated that tied-weight autoencoders improve learning efficiency compared to untied versions while mimicking optimal properties of Principal Component Analysis and Restricted Boltzmann Machines \cite{kim2024}.

\subsection{Depth-wise Parameter Sharing}

Depth-wise sharing involves sharing depthwise convolution filters across multiple layers or branches, extending parameter tying concepts specifically to depthwise convolutions. Since depthwise filters capture low-level features like edges and textures, certain filters can be reused across network locations, reducing redundancy without significant loss in representational power \cite{jeong2021}.

\label{fig:depthwise_sharing}
\end{figure}

Vu et al. (2019) explored multi-domain depthwise sharing where spatial filtering remained common across tasks while pointwise convolutions stayed task-specific, yielding smaller multi-domain models with competitive performance \cite{vu2019}. This assumes low-level features are universal across domains while allowing task-specific channel recombination.

Within single networks, Yan et al. (2024) shared bottleneck filter weights within ResNet-50 stages, achieving approximately $50\%$ parameter reduction while maintaining ImageNet accuracy \cite{yan2024}. This suggests many spatial filters perform similar functions across network depths and can be effectively shared.

\textbf{Paired Depth-wise Sharing:} Rather than global sharing, paired strategies create parameter ties between specific layer pairs, balancing parameter reduction with model diversity. Examples include symmetric encoder-decoder pairing where corresponding layers share depthwise filters, and parallel branch sharing in multi-stream architectures. This approach provides regularization by encouraging aligned feature extraction while preserving specialized processing capabilities.

\subsubsection{Implementation Considerations}

Implementing encoder-decoder weight sharing requires careful architectural design, particularly maintaining symmetry in layer count and hidden dimensions between encoder and decoder components. Some models achieve this through literal parameter reuse, where a single stack of layers is traversed twice during forward passes, with modifications like masked attention patterns distinguishing encoding from decoding phases.

Dabre and Fujita found that sharing all layers between encoder and decoder in Transformers for neural machine translation maintained performance close to standard architectures, even when six layers performed double duty for both encoding and decoding phases \cite{dabre2019}. Beyond text processing, Chi et al. successfully applied ALBERT-style sharing to Transformer speech recognition models, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing parameter counts \cite{chi2021}.

\subsubsection{Benefits and Trade-offs}

The advantages of parameter sharing extend beyond simple model compression. First, the reduced model size (often 50\% or greater) translates directly to lower memory requirements and faster inference—critical factors for edge deployment and mobile applications \cite{howard2017, sandler2018}. Second, shared weights can function as an implicit regularization mechanism: by forcing the model to reuse features across different contexts, sharing may enhance generalization and reduce overfitting \cite{desai2024}.

However, parameter sharing is not universally beneficial. Its effectiveness varies based on model architecture, task complexity, and implementation approach. The constraints imposed by sharing can limit representational capacity, potentially creating bottlenecks in models dealing with highly diverse inputs or complex mapping functions. Successful implementations must balance the efficiency gains against potential performance trade-offs, often through careful ablation studies and architectural modifications.

\subsubsection{Critical Analysis and Project Implications}

The synthesis of parameter sharing literature reveals several \textbf{fundamental insights} that directly inform our architectural design decisions for RAAGR2-Net compression:

\textbf{Hierarchical Sharing Effectiveness:} The literature demonstrates that parameter sharing effectiveness follows a clear hierarchy: \textit{low-level features > mid-level features > high-level features}. This insight is particularly relevant for medical segmentation where spatial filters capturing edges, textures, and basic geometric patterns are highly reusable across different anatomical regions. Our SharedDepthwiseBlock design leverages this principle by specifically targeting depthwise convolutions, which primarily capture spatial patterns that exhibit high redundancy in medical imaging.

\textbf{Task-Specificity Paradox:} While conventional wisdom suggests that specialized tasks require specialized parameters, the medical imaging literature reveals a paradox: the more specialized the domain (e.g., brain tumor segmentation), the greater the potential for parameter sharing due to the constrained visual vocabulary. This counterintuitive finding drives our hypothesis that RAAGR2-Net's specialized nature makes it particularly amenable to aggressive weight sharing strategies.

\textbf{Architectural Coupling Insights:} Analysis of encoder-decoder sharing strategies reveals that successful weight sharing requires \textit{architectural symmetry} and \textit{functional alignment}. However, our critical evaluation of the literature suggests that perfect symmetry (as in ALBERT) may be overly restrictive for segmentation tasks where encoding and decoding serve fundamentally different purposes. This insight led to our paired sharing approach that maintains some asymmetry while achieving significant parameter reduction.

\textbf{Scale-Dependent Compression Dynamics:} The literature reveals that compression effectiveness exhibits strong scale dependence: techniques that work well for large models may fail catastrophically for medium-sized architectures like RAAGR2-Net (8.91M parameters). This scale sensitivity explains why direct application of techniques developed for billion-parameter language models often fails in medical imaging contexts, necessitating our domain-specific approach.

These insights collectively establish that effective compression for medical segmentation requires a \textbf{domain-aware architectural approach} rather than generic post-training optimization, forming the theoretical foundation for our SharedDepthwiseBlock methodology.

\subsection{Parameter Sharing vs Pruning}
Unlike Pruning that zeros weights or remove connvections, parameter sharing involves reusing the same weights so that multiple connections refer to this same value this can be done in a structured way by sharing weights of lattyers or filters or randomly, in 2024 a stydy by Desai proved that parameter sharing outperformed pruning \cite{desai2024}, while agressive pruning leads to a degradation in performance, Recent research has proposed that aggressive sharing can improve performance and improve generalization by forcing the network to learn the reusable features  \cite{kim2021}

\subsection{U-Net Derivatives for Medical Image Segmentation}

U-Net and its derivatives have become the de facto standard for medical image segmentation, owing to their encoder-decoder architecture and ability to capture both local and global contextual information. The architectural choices in RAAGR2-Net are deeply rooted in the evolution of U-Net-based models, each introducing innovations to address the unique challenges of medical imaging \cite{Abidin2024, Wang2023Review}.

\label{fig:unet_evolution}
\end{figure}

Attention U-Net augments the standard U-Net with spatial attention mechanisms, enabling the model to focus on relevant anatomical regions while suppressing background noise. This enhancement has been shown to improve segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as brain tumor delineation \cite{Oktay2018AttentionUNet, Abidin2024}.

R2U-Net incorporates recurrent residual blocks, allowing for iterative refinement of feature representations. This design captures robust contextual features essential for accurate segmentation but introduces additional computational overhead—a trade-off that underscores the need for subsequent model compression \cite{Alom2019R2UNet, Abidin2024}.

ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) modules, as integrated in RAAGR2-Net, enable the capture of multi-scale contextual information without a prohibitive increase in model complexity. By employing parallel dilated convolutions with varying rates, ASPP modules enhance the model's ability to delineate intricate tumor boundaries, a critical requirement in brain tumor segmentation \cite{Chen2018ASPP, Rehman2023RAAGR2}.

Collectively, these architectural innovations have propelled the field of medical image segmentation forward, but their computational demands have also highlighted the necessity for effective model compression and optimization strategies.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

This chapter presents a comprehensive methodology for implementing and evaluating pruning techniques and weight-sharing strategies on the RAAGR2-Net architecture for brain tumor segmentation. The methodology encompasses three main components: (1) analysis of the RAAGR2-Net architecture and its computational characteristics, (2) implementation of various pruning techniques, and (3) development of the proposed weight-sharing strategies tailored to the structure of the RAAGR2-Net.

\subsection{RAAGR2-Net Architecture}

\subsubsection{Encoder-Decoder Backbone}

The RAAGR2-Net follows a modified U-Net architecture with an encoder-decoder design that progressively captures features at multiple scales \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}. The encoder pathway consists of four stages with progressive channel expansion: starting with 32 channels after the initial ReASPP3 module, then expanding to 64, 128, 256, and finally 512 channels at the bottleneck. Between consecutive stages, max-pooling operations with a stride of 2 reduce spatial dimensions, enabling the capture of increasingly abstract features. The decoder pathway mirrors this arrangement with a symmetric progression from 512→256→128→64→32 channels, using upsampling operations to restore spatial resolution \cite{Alom2019R2UNet}.

Each spatial resolution level in both encoder and decoder contains yes specialized modules that enhance the network's representational capacity. Skip connections between corresponding encoder and decoder levels help preserve spatial information that might otherwise be lost during downsampling, facilitating precise localization of tumor boundaries—a crucial requirement for clinical utility \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}.

\subsubsection{Recurrent CNN Blocks (RRCNNBlock)}

A distinctive feature of RAAGR2-Net is its use of Recurrent Residual CNN blocks (RRCNNBlock), which enable iterative refinement of feature representations \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2, Alom2019R2UNet}. Each RRCNNBlock consists of a dimensionality-reducing 1×1 convolution followed by two sequential RecurrentBlocks, arranged in a residual configuration.

The RecurrentBlock applies a shared convolutional operation iteratively ($t$ times, typically $t=2$) to the same feature map, allowing for progressive feature refinement without introducing additional parameters. Mathematically, for an input feature map $x$, the RecurrentBlock computes:

\begin{align}
x_1 &= x \\
\intertext{For $i = 1$ to $t$:}
x_1 &= \textrm{Conv}(x + x_1)
\end{align}

This recurrent structure provides an effective mechanism for capturing complex patterns with a relatively modest parameter count \cite{Alom2019R2UNet}. Each convolutional operation within the RecurrentBlock consists of a depthwise separable convolution (3×3 kernel) followed by a pointwise projection (1×1 kernel), batch normalization, and ReLU activation. This design choice further reduces the computational burden while maintaining representational capacity.

\subsubsection{ReASPP3 Module}

The Recurrent Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ReASPP3) module enhances the network's ability to capture multi-scale contextual information, which is particularly important for accurately delineating heterogeneous tumor regions with varying sizes and shapes \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}. The module consists of four parallel branches, each applying convolutions with different dilation rates:

1. Standard convolution (dilation rate = 1)
2. Dilated convolution with rate = 3
3. Dilated convolution with rate = 6 (2×3)
4. Dilated convolution with rate = 9 (3×3)

Each branch begins with a depthwise separable convolution using the specified dilation rate, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. A second 1×1 convolution further transforms the features, and a residual connection is added from the output of the first to the second convolution. The outputs from all four branches are concatenated along with the original input features, and a final 1×1 convolution reduces the channel dimension to the desired output size.

The use of varied dilation rates enables the module to capture features at multiple effective receptive fields without increasing spatial dimensions or parameter count dramatically. This multi-scale context aggregation is crucial for distinguishing between tumor subregions (e.g., necrotic core, enhancing tumor, and edema) that may appear similar in isolation but differ in their spatial context \cite{Chen2018ASPP}.

\subsubsection{Attention Gates}

Attention gates are integrated at each decoder level to emphasize relevant features in the skip connections from the encoder before they are combined with the upsampled features \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2, Oktay2018AttentionUNet}. For a given feature map $x$ from the encoder and the corresponding upsampled feature map $g$ from the decoder, the attention mechanism computes:

\begin{align}
g' &= W_g * g \quad \textrm{(transform gating signal)} \\
x' &= W_x * x \quad \textrm{(transform input features)} \\
\alpha &= \sigma(\textrm{ReLU}(g' + x')) \quad \textrm{(compute attention coefficients)} \\
y &= x \cdot \alpha \quad \textrm{(apply attention to input features)}
\end{align}

where $\sigma$ represents the sigmoid activation function, ensuring that attention coefficients are in the range $[0,1]$.

These gates act as a soft region proposal mechanism, selectively highlighting features relevant to the tumor regions while suppressing background noise. This targeted feature refinement is particularly valuable in medical imaging tasks where the regions of interest (tumors) often constitute a small portion of the overall image volume \cite{Oktay2018AttentionUNet}.

\subsubsection{Loss Function}
RAAGR2-Net employs a composite loss function that combines weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) with the Dice loss to address class imbalance—a common challenge in brain tumor segmentation where tumor regions typically occupy a small fraction of the total volume \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{total}} = \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{BCE}} + (1-\lambda) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{Dice}}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is a weighting factor (typically set to 0.5). The BCE component provides pixel-wise supervision, while the Dice loss directly optimizes for overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentations. This combination yields more balanced training and better performance on small tumor regions \cite{Rehman2023RAAGR2}.

\subsection{Pruning Implementation}

\subsubsection{Methodological Framework for Pruning Evaluation}

To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation of pruning techniques, this study employs a dual-evaluation framework that assesses both immediate deployment scenarios and optimal performance scenarios:

\textbf{Immediate Deployment Evaluation:} Pruning techniques are evaluated without post-pruning fine-tuning to assess their suitability for scenarios requiring immediate deployment, such as clinical environments where retraining resources may be limited.

\textbf{Optimal Performance Evaluation:} Following standard pruning literature protocols, magnitude-based and SNIP pruning methods undergo fine-tuning recovery training to assess their maximum achievable performance. Fine-tuning was conducted for 20 epochs using the same training protocol as the base model, with learning rate reduced to 1×10⁻⁵ to prevent catastrophic forgetting while allowing performance recovery.

This dual framework enables direct comparison with architectural modification approaches (which require no retraining) while also establishing fair performance baselines that reflect the state-of-the-art in pruning methodology.

\subsubsection{Magnitude-Based Pruning}

Our implementation of magnitude-based pruning focuses on removing filters in convolutional layers based on their L₂ norm magnitudes, following the approaches in \cite{Wu2023, Han2015Learning, Zhu2017To}. The procedure consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Weight Magnitude Calculation}: For each convolutional layer, we compute the L₂ norm of each filter:
   
   \begin{equation}
   M(f_i) = \sqrt{\sum_{j} (w_{ij})^2}
   \end{equation}
   
   where $w_{ij}$ represents the individual weights of filter $i$.

\item \textbf{Threshold Determination}: Filters are ranked based on their magnitudes, and a percentile threshold is determined according to the desired pruning ratio. For example, with a pruning ratio of 0.3, filters with magnitudes below the 30th percentile are candidates for removal.

\item \textbf{Dependency Analysis}: Before actually pruning any filter, we analyze the network's dependency structure using the DepGraph algorithm \cite{Fang2023DepGraph}. This step is crucial as removing a filter from one layer impacts connected layers, requiring consistent dimensionality adjustments throughout the model.

\item \textbf{Mask Generation}: A binary pruning mask is generated for each layer, where zeros correspond to pruned connections and ones to retained connections.



The primary advantage of magnitude-based pruning is its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly for convolutional layers where filter norms often correlate well with their importance to the network's output.

\subsubsection{SNIP Pruning}

SNIP (Single-shot Network Pruning) \cite{Lee2019SNIP} offers a unique perspective by evaluating connection sensitivity at initialization, prior to training. Our implementation proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Connection Sensitivity Calculation}: For each parameter $\theta_i$, we compute its sensitivity score $s_i$ based on the gradient of the loss with respect to a binary mask $c_i$:
   
   \begin{equation}
   s_i = \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_i} \cdot \theta_i \right|
   \end{equation}
   
   where $c_i$ is a mask variable that, when set to zero, removes the parameter from the network.

\item \textbf{Global Ranking}: All sensitivities across the network are globally ranked, and a global pruning threshold is applied to remove the desired percentage of least sensitive connections.

\item \textbf{Dependency-Preserving Pruning}: Unlike the original SNIP implementation, we integrate DepGraph's dependency analysis \cite{Fang2023DepGraph} to ensure that pruning maintains structural consistency across the model.

\item \textbf{Training From Scratch}: After pruning, the model is trained from scratch with the pruned architecture.
\end{enumerate}

SNIP's advantage lies in its ability to prune before training, potentially saving significant computational resources compared to train-prune-retrain approaches.

\subsubsection{DepGraph Pruning}

The Dependency Graph (DepGraph) algorithm \cite{Fang2023DepGraph, Cai2022Dependency} is the backbone of our pruning framework, enabling consistent structural modifications across the RAAGR2-Net architecture. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Graph Construction: During a forward pass with a dummy input, we trace the computational graph of the network, capturing all tensor operations and their dependencies.

2. Dependency Identification: For each prunable parameter, we identify all affected modules that require consistent changes. For example, pruning the output channels of a convolution requires pruning the corresponding input channels of the next layer.

3. Group Formation: Coupled parameters are grouped together to ensure consistent pruning. A pruning operation on one parameter triggers corresponding operations on all dependent parameters.

4. Automated Mask Transformation: When operations like concatenations or splits occur in the network, DepGraph automatically transforms the pruning indices to maintain consistency.

5. Pruning Execution: Once dependencies are resolved, pruning can be executed safely, removing parameters while maintaining the network's architectural integrity.

DepGraph is particularly valuable for complex architectures like RAAGR2-Net, where recurrent connections, skip connections, and attention mechanisms create intricate dependency patterns that would be challenging to handle manually.

\subsection{Shared-Weight Implementation}

\subsubsection{SharedDepthwiseBlock Design}

To further reduce the parameter count of RAAGR2-Net, we developed a novel SharedDepthwiseBlock that enables weight sharing across the different branches of the ReASPP3 module. The key innovation is the use of a single set of depthwise convolutional weights (kernel size 3×3) across all dilation rates, while maintaining separate pointwise (1×1) convolutions for each branch.

The SharedDepthwiseBlock is implemented as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A single 3×3 depthwise convolutional kernel (weights and biases) is defined at the ReASPP3 module level, shared across all dilated branches.

\item For each branch, the shared depthwise kernel is applied with a different dilation rate (1, 3, 6, 9), but using the same weight values:
   
   \begin{equation}
   y_{i} = F_{\textrm{dw}}(x, W_{\textrm{shared}}, d_i)
   \end{equation}
   
   where $F_{\textrm{dw}}$ denotes the depthwise convolution operation, $W_{\textrm{shared}}$ is the shared weight tensor, and $d_i$ is the dilation rate specific to branch $i$.

\item Branch-specific pointwise (1×1) convolutions transform the depthwise outputs to the desired channel dimension:
   
   \begin{equation}
   z_{i} = F_{\textrm{pw}}(y_{i}, W_{\textrm{pw},i})
   \end{equation}
   
   where $F_{\textrm{pw}}$ is the pointwise convolution and $W_{\textrm{pw},i}$ represents the branch-specific weights.

\item Residual projections are added around each block to ensure stable training despite the parameter sharing:
   
   \begin{equation}
   \textrm{out}_{i} = z_{i} + F_{\textrm{res}}(y_{i})
   \end{equation}
   
   where $F_{\textrm{res}}$ is a 1×1 convolutional projection.
\end{enumerate}

This approach reduces the parameter count in the ReASPP3 module from $4 \times (C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3 \times C_{\textrm{out}})$ to $(C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3) + 4 \times (C_{\textrm{in}} \times 1 \times 1 \times C_{\textrm{out}})$, yielding a substantial reduction in model size while preserving the multi-scale feature extraction capability.

\subsubsection{Integration into ReASPP3}

The integration of SharedDepthwiseBlock into the ReASPP3 module requires architectural modifications to respect the weight-sharing mechanism. The original independent branches are replaced with SharedDepthwiseBlocks that reference the same set of depthwise convolutional weights:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The shared depthwise convolutional weights are initialized as model parameters at the ReASPP3 module level:
   
   \begin{align}
   W_{\textrm{shared}} &\in \mathbb{R}^{C_{\textrm{in}} \times 1 \times 3 \times 3} \\
   b_{\textrm{shared}} &\in \mathbb{R}^{C_{\textrm{in}}}
   \end{align}

\item Four SharedDepthwiseBlocks are instantiated, each configured with a different dilation rate but referencing the same $W_{\textrm{shared}}$ and $b_{\textrm{shared}}$ parameters:
   
   \begin{align}
   \textrm{Block}_1 &= \textrm{SharedDepthwiseBlock}(C_{\textrm{in}}, C_{\textrm{out}}, d=1, W_{\textrm{shared}}, b_{\textrm{shared}}) \\
   \textrm{Block}_2 &= \textrm{SharedDepthwiseBlock}(C_{\textrm{in}}, C_{\textrm{out}}, d=3, W_{\textrm{shared}}, b_{\textrm{shared}}) \\
   \textrm{Block}_3 &= \textrm{SharedDepthwiseBlock}(C_{\textrm{in}}, C_{\textrm{out}}, d=6, W_{\textrm{shared}}, b_{\textrm{shared}}) \\
   \textrm{Block}_4 &= \textrm{SharedDepthwiseBlock}(C_{\textrm{in}}, C_{\textrm{out}}, d=9, W_{\textrm{shared}}, b_{\textrm{shared}})
   \end{align}

\item The forward pass computes outputs from each block, concatenates them with the input, and applies a final 1×1 convolution to fuse features:
   
   \begin{equation}
   \textrm{out} = F_{1 \times 1}(\textrm{concat}([\textrm{Block}_1(x), \textrm{Block}_2(x), \textrm{Block}_3(x), \textrm{Block}_4(x), x]))
   \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

This integration ensures that while the ReASPP3 module maintains its multi-scale feature extraction capability, it does so with significantly fewer parameters. Our analytical calculations indicate a parameter reduction of approximately 66% in the ReASPP3 modules compared to the original implementation.

\subsubsection{Parameter Reduction Analysis}

The parameter reduction achieved through our SharedDepthwiseBlock can be quantified through a comparative analysis of the original and modified ReASPP3 modules:

1. Original ReASPP3: Each of the four branches contains a full 3×3 convolutional layer with $C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3 \times C_{\textrm{out}}$ parameters, plus batch normalization parameters. The total parameter count for the convolutional layers alone (excluding the final fusion layer) is approximately $4 \times (C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3 \times C_{\textrm{out}})$.

2. SharedDepthwiseBlock ReASPP3: The shared depthwise convolution has $C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3$ parameters, and each of the four branches has a pointwise (1×1) convolution with $C_{\textrm{in}} \times 1 \times 1 \times C_{\textrm{out}}$ parameters. The total parameter count is approximately $(C_{\textrm{in}} \times 3 \times 3) + 4 \times (C_{\textrm{in}} \times 1 \times 1 \times C_{\textrm{out}})$.

For a typical ReASPP3 module with $C_{\textrm{in}} = C_{\textrm{out}} = 128$, the original implementation requires approximately 589,824 parameters for the convolutional layers, while our SharedDepthwiseBlock implementation requires only 199,168 parameters—a reduction of 66.2%.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Relationship to Transformers}

Our SharedDepthwiseBlock, encoder-decoder sharing and paired depth wise sharing, draws conceptual inspiration from weight-tying principles in transformer architectures \cite{Jeong2021, Vaswani2017Attention}. In transformers, the same set of weights is used for multiple heads in multi-head attention, with projections handling the differentiation between heads. Similarly, our approach uses a single set of depthwise convolutional weights across different dilation rates, with branch-specific pointwise convolutions providing specialized feature transformation.

This connection to transformers is not merely theoretical; it reflects a broader trend in deep learning toward parameter efficiency through strategic weight sharing. By allowing a single set of weights to be used in multiple contexts (different dilation rates), the model can leverage a compact parameter set to express diverse functionalities—a principle at the heart of efficient neural architecture design \cite{Howard2019Searching, Jeong2021}.

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:implementation}

\end{itemize}

This organization facilitates ablation studies by enabling direct comparison between different pruning strategies and model architectures while maintaining consistent evaluation protocols and baseline references.

\subsection{Training Setup}
The experimental framework employs a comprehensive training pipeline with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure optimal model convergence while maintaining reproducibility across experiments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimizer}: Adam optimization algorithm with an initial learning rate of 1 × 10\textsuperscript{-4}, chosen for its adaptive moment estimation capabilities that facilitate stable training of deep networks with recurrent components \cite{Loshchilov2017}.
    
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate Schedule}: ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on validation loss plateaus, decreasing to 1 × 10\textsuperscript{-5} during fine-tuning phases after pruning to prevent catastrophic forgetting \cite{Xin2020}.
    
    \item \textbf{Training Epochs}: Differentiated based on pruning methodology requirements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 20 epochs for finetuning approach.
        \item 50--70 epochs for training from scratch methods (dependency graph pruning), allowing sufficient retraining cycles between pruning iterations to recover accuracy \cite{Wu2023, Frankle2018}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Batch Size}: Configured dynamically based on available GPU memory, ranging from 8 to 16 samples per batch for 3D volumes, balancing computational efficiency with gradient stability \cite{Masters2018}.

    \item \textbf{Early Stopping}: Patience of 10 epochs with minimum improvement threshold of 0.0001 in validation loss to prevent overfitting while ensuring convergence.
    
    \item \textbf{Mixed Precision Training}: Optional automatic mixed precision (AMP) during training to accelerate computation while maintaining numerical stability, particularly beneficial for 3D medical image processing \cite{Micikevicius2018}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment Tracking with MLFlow}
Experiment tracking was implemented using MLFlow to enable systematic comparison across pruning methodologies and model variants, with the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Custom MLFlowExperiment Class}: A specialized wrapper class was developed to standardize experiment tracking across all model variants, providing consistent logging interfaces for metrics, parameters, artifacts, and model checkpoints.
    
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Run Organization}: Experiments were organized into logical hierarchies, with parent runs for each pruning technique (e.g., "magnitude\_pruning", "network\_slimming") and child runs for specific configurations, facilitating multi-level comparative analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Metrics Logging}: Automated tracking of both training and validation metrics at each epoch, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overall performance metrics: Dice coefficient, mean IoU, and loss values.
        \item Class-specific metrics: Separate Dice scores for each tumor subregion (classes 2, 3, and 4).
        \item Model efficiency metrics: Parameter counts, inference speed, and compression ratios.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Pruning-Specific Parameters}: Dedicated tracking of pruning-related hyperparameters, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pruning ratios and thresholds.
        \item Original vs. pruned parameter counts.
        \item Channel and filter statistics before and after pruning.
        \item Resulting model sparsity.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Artifact Management}: Systematic storage of model checkpoints, configuration files, serialized pruning masks, and visualization artifacts such as segmentation samples and training curves.
    
    \item \textbf{Model Registry Integration}: Automatic registration of best-performing models for each configuration, allowing efficient model versioning and retrieval for deployment.
\end{itemize}

This MLFlow infrastructure not only enabled rigorous comparative analysis but also ensured reproducibility by capturing the complete experimental context, including random seeds, environmental details, and full hyperparameter configurations.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
The evaluation framework employs a comprehensive set of metrics to assess both segmentation quality and model efficiency:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dice Coefficient (F1 Score)}: Primary metric for segmentation accuracy, measuring the overlap between predicted and ground truth masks. Particularly well-suited for medical image segmentation due to its robustness to class imbalance where tumor regions typically constitute a small fraction of the total volume \cite{Sudre2017}.
    
    \item \textbf{Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)}: Complementary to Dice, mIoU provides a more stringent evaluation by penalizing false positives more heavily, offering insights into worst-case performance scenarios \cite{Wang2023Review}.
    
    \item \textbf{Class-wise Dice Coefficients}: Separate metrics for each tumor subregion:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item NCR/NET (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core) - Class 2
        \item ET (enhancing tumor) - Class 3 
        \item ED (peritumoral edema) - Class 4
    \end{itemize}
    These class-specific metrics are critical for clinical utility assessment, as different tumor components have varying prognostic significance \cite{Abidin2024}.
    
    \item \textbf{Model Size}: Total parameter count before and after compression, reported in both raw counts and megabytes, directly indicating memory footprint reduction.
    
    \item \textbf{Inference Speed}: Measured in frames per second (FPS) on target hardware (CPU/GPU/edge devices), assessing real-time feasibility in clinical settings. Tests were conducted with standardized input dimensions to ensure consistent comparison \cite{Chen2019}.
    
    \item \textbf{Relative Accuracy-Efficiency Tradeoff}: Composite metric calculated as the product of relative accuracy preservation and parameter reduction ratio, enabling holistic comparison of pruning techniques \cite{Li2023}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset}
The Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset was used for all experiments, representing the gold standard for brain tumor segmentation algorithm development and evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multimodal MRI Sequences}: Each case includes four complementary MRI modalities that highlight different tumor characteristics \cite{Bakas2017}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item T1-weighted (T1): Provides structural anatomical information.
        \item T1 with contrast enhancement (T1ce): Highlights areas with blood-brain barrier disruption, typically corresponding to active tumor regions.
        \item T2-weighted (T2): Sensitive to water content, revealing peritumoral edema.
        \item Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR): Suppresses cerebrospinal fluid signals, accentuating abnormal tissue adjacent to ventricles.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Segmentation Labels}: Expert-annotated ground truth masks with four distinct classes \cite{Menze2015}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Background (label 0): Normal brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid.
        \item NCR/NET (label 1): Necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core.
        \item ED (label 2): Peritumoral edema.
        \item ET (label 4): Enhancing tumor.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing}: All volumes were co-registered to the same anatomical template, skull-stripped, and interpolated to isotropic 1mm³ resolution, with intensity normalization applied within each modality independently.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Split}: The dataset was partitioned with a 70\%/15\%/15\% split for training, validation, and testing, respectively, maintaining consistent distribution of high-grade gliomas (HGG) and low-grade gliomas (LGG) across partitions.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Insights from Tabular Analysis}

The comprehensive tabular analysis reveals several critical findings:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Architectural Modifications Dominance}: The Depthwise Shared and Paired Shared variants achieve the best overall efficiency scores, demonstrating that strategic weight sharing outperforms traditional pruning approaches for immediate deployment scenarios.
    
    \item \textbf{Pruning Method Dichotomy}: Unstructured pruning methods (magnitude-based and SNIP) show a stark performance dichotomy between unfinetuned (catastrophic degradation) and finetuned (excellent recovery) variants, highlighting the critical importance of post-pruning recovery protocols.
    
    \item \textbf{Practical vs. Theoretical Compression}: While finetuned pruning methods achieve excellent segmentation performance, they provide no actual parameter reduction or model size benefits, limiting their practical deployment advantages compared to architectural modifications.
    
    \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency Spectrum}: GPU memory reductions range from 47.3\% (Paired Shared) to -23.6\% (Encoder-Decoder Shared), indicating that compression effectiveness varies significantly based on architectural choices and sharing strategies.
    
    \item \textbf{Clinical Deployment Readiness}: Only architectural modifications and DepGraph 10\% maintain clinically acceptable performance (>95\% of baseline Dice coefficient) without requiring additional training infrastructure, making them suitable for immediate clinical deployment.
\end{enumerate}

These detailed results provide the empirical foundation for the conclusion that architectural modifications through strategic weight sharing represent the most effective approach to neural network compression for medical image segmentation applications requiring immediate deployment readiness and practical efficiency gains.

\subsection{Comprehensive Performance Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:comprehensive_analysis} provides a holistic view of model performance across different optimization strategies. The analysis reveals several key insights about the trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and model complexity in medical image segmentation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{comprehensive_performance_analysis.pdf}
\caption{Comprehensive performance analysis of RAAGR2-Net optimization strategies. (A) Overall performance comparison showing Dice coefficient and Mean IoU across model variants. (B) Class-wise performance heatmap revealing differential impact on tumor subregions. (C) Model efficiency comparison highlighting parameter count and model size trade-offs. (D) Performance vs efficiency scatter plot demonstrating the superior balance achieved by architectural modifications compared to traditional pruning methods. Bubble size represents inference time, with larger bubbles indicating slower inference.}
\label{fig:comprehensive_analysis}
\end{figure}

The results demonstrate that architectural modifications (ENC-CON, Depthwise Shared, and Paired Shared variants) maintain excellent segmentation accuracy while achieving substantial parameter reduction. Notably, the Depthwise Shared model achieves a 43.4\% parameter reduction with only a 0.12\% drop in Dice coefficient (from 0.985 to 0.984), representing an exceptional efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

The evaluation of pruning methods reveals a critical dependency on post-pruning fine-tuning protocols. Without fine-tuning, magnitude-based and SNIP pruning show severe performance degradation (Dice coefficients of 0.755 and 0.279 respectively at 20\% pruning). However, with proper 20-epoch fine-tuning, both methods recover to near-baseline performance: magnitude-based pruning achieves 0.985 Dice coefficient, while SNIP achieves 0.985 Dice coefficient, both essentially matching the base model performance of 0.985.

Class-wise analysis reveals that architectural modifications preserve performance more uniformly across tumor subregions compared to unfine-tuned pruning methods. However, fine-tuned pruning methods demonstrate excellent class-specific recovery, with SNIP achieving particularly strong performance across all tumor classes (C2: 0.846, C3: 0.826, C4: 0.856).

\subsection{Pruning Method Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:pruning_analysis} presents a detailed comparison of three pruning strategies: magnitude-based pruning, SNIP one-shot pruning, and dependency graph (DepGraph) pruning across multiple evaluation dimensions.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pruning_analysis.pdf}

(F) Accuracy vs speed trade-off scatter plot with the base model (red star) serving as the performance anchor.}
\label{fig:pruning_analysis}
\end{figure}

The pruning analysis reveals several critical findings:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fine-tuning Impact}: The most significant finding is the dramatic impact of post-pruning fine-tuning. SNIP pruning demonstrates a remarkable recovery from 0.279 to 0.985 Dice coefficient (245\% improvement), while magnitude-based pruning improves from 0.755 to 0.985 (30\% improvement). This highlights fine-tuning as an essential component of pruning protocols for complex medical architectures.

\item \textbf{DepGraph Robustness}: Dependency graph pruning demonstrates superior performance retention even without fine-tuning, maintaining a Dice coefficient of 0.953 at 10\% pruning compared to 0.742 for magnitude-based and 0.285 for SNIP pruning in their unfine-tuned state.

\item \textbf{Deployment Trade-offs}: The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate deployment readiness and optimal performance. Architectural modifications provide immediate deployment advantages, while pruning methods require fine-tuning protocols but can achieve competitive final performance.

\item \textbf{Sparse Representation Limitations}: While fine-tuned pruning achieves excellent accuracy, the sparse representations still present challenges for hardware acceleration, as irregular sparsity patterns are not efficiently supported by modern inference engines.

\item \textbf{Sparsity Achievement}: All pruning methods successfully achieve their target sparsity ratios, confirming effective parameter removal. However, practical compression benefits vary significantly based on hardware support for sparse operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resource Efficiency Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:resource_analysis} examines the computational and memory efficiency characteristics of different model variants, providing insights into their practical deployment feasibility.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{resource_efficiency_analysis.pdf}

(D) Overall efficiency radar chart normalizing speed, memory, size, and accuracy metrics, with larger areas indicating better overall efficiency.}
\label{fig:resource_analysis}
\end{figure}

The resource efficiency analysis highlights several important characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Shared-weight models demonstrate superior GPU memory efficiency, with the Paired Shared variant achieving 47\% reduction in peak GPU memory usage (from 0.55GB to 0.29GB) while maintaining comparable RAM requirements.

\item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: The relationship between FLOPs and inference time reveals that architectural modifications provide more predictable efficiency gains compared to pruning methods. Depthwise Shared models achieve 25.5\% reduction in FLOPs with proportional inference time improvements.

\item \textbf{Parameter Utilization}: The parameter efficiency analysis demonstrates that shared-weight models achieve superior parameter utilization, maintaining high Dice scores with significantly fewer parameters. This suggests that strategic weight sharing acts as an effective regularization mechanism.

\item \textbf{Overall Efficiency Profile}: The radar chart analysis reveals that architectural modifications (particularly Depthwise and Paired Shared variants) achieve more balanced efficiency profiles across all dimensions compared to pruning methods, which often excel in one dimension while degrading others.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence}

A profound yet frequently underexplored dimension of neural network compression is its transformative impact on training dynamics and convergence properties. Our rigorous analysis reveals intricate patterns in how architectural modifications fundamentally alter the optimization landscape, yielding insights with far-reaching implications for efficient deep learning.

\label{fig:training_curves}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Comparative Convergence Analysis}

A careful examination of the validation loss curves reveals the actual optimization behaviors across different architectural variants:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Base RAAGR2-Net (Figure~\ref{fig:base_training})}: The validation loss curve shows a steep initial decline from approximately 0.75 to 0.2 within the first 5 epochs, followed by gradual convergence to around 0.1 by epoch 35. The curve demonstrates stable, monotonic decrease with minimal oscillations, indicating consistent training progress throughout the 35-epoch cycle.

\item \textbf{Depthwise Shared (Figure~\ref{fig:depthwise_training})}: The validation loss exhibits a similar initial steep decline from 0.75 to approximately 0.2 in the first 5 epochs, then continues decreasing more gradually to reach near 0.08 by epoch 35. The curve shows remarkably smooth convergence with virtually no oscillations, suggesting that the parameter sharing constraint creates a more stable optimization landscape.

\item \textbf{Paired Shared (Figure~\ref{fig:paired_training})}: This model shows the most gradual convergence pattern, with validation loss decreasing steadily from approximately 3.5 to near 0 over the full 35 epochs. The curve demonstrates consistent, smooth progression without significant oscillations, indicating stable but slower convergence compared to other variants.

\item \textbf{Encoder-Decoder Shared (Figure~\ref{fig:encdec_training})}: The validation loss curve shows rapid initial convergence, dropping sharply from approximately 6.0 to below 1.0 within the first 10 epochs, then continuing to decrease gradually to near 0 by epoch 35. This model achieves the fastest initial convergence among all variants.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Mechanisms of Enhanced Training Stability}

The enhanced training stability observed in the Depthwise Shared architecture can be attributed to several complementary mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Reduced Parameter Search Space}: The 43.4\% reduction in parameter count constrains the optimization space, creating a more focused search during backpropagation. This constraint reduces the volume of poor local minima that might otherwise create training instabilities.

\item \textbf{Forced Feature Reuse}: By sharing depthwise filters across channels, the model is compelled to develop universal feature extractors that generalize across different feature maps, rather than learning redundant, channel-specific filters. This architectural constraint guides the optimization process toward learning more fundamental visual primitives.

\item \textbf{Implicit Regularization}: Parameter sharing functions as a form of hard parameter tying, equivalent to applying strong regularization that forces groups of weights to be identical. This prevents the model from memorizing dataset-specific patterns and creates smoother loss landscapes.

\item \textbf{Gradient Averaging Effect}: During backpropagation, gradients from multiple computational paths flow back to the same shared parameters, effectively averaging the update signals. This creates a more stable optimization trajectory with reduced variance in parameter updates, as evidenced by the remarkably smooth validation loss curve.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Training Efficiency and Computational Implications}

The practical implications of these architectural modifications extend beyond theoretical interest to tangible computational benefits:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training Time Reduction}: The complete 35-epoch training cycle required:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Base RAAGR2-Net: 47.5 minutes
    \item Encoder-Decoder Shared: 46.9 minutes (1.3\% reduction)
    \item Paired Shared: 42.2 minutes (11.2\% reduction)
    \item Depthwise Shared: 39.9 minutes (16.0\% reduction)
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Training Stability}: The validation loss curves reveal distinct training characteristics:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Depthwise Shared: Most stable convergence with smooth, oscillation-free validation loss
    \item Encoder-Decoder Shared: Fastest initial convergence in the first 10 epochs
    \item Base RAAGR2-Net: Standard stable convergence pattern
    \item Paired Shared: Most gradual but consistent convergence pattern
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Peak GPU memory utilization during training with batch size 16 was reduced by 25.7\% for the Depthwise Shared model, enabling larger batch sizes or deployment on less powerful hardware.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Implications for Medical AI Development}

These findings have important implications for medical AI development, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The Depthwise Shared architecture demonstrates significant training efficiency benefits, offering a 16.0\% reduction in training time with enhanced stability characteristics. The remarkably smooth validation loss convergence suggests improved optimization dynamics that may lead to more robust and reliable training outcomes.

Furthermore, the enhanced stability of validation metrics suggests that these models may be more robust to variations in clinical data, a critical consideration for deploying AI systems in healthcare settings where data distribution shifts are common. The reduced computational and memory requirements also democratize access to advanced AI techniques for medical centers with limited computational resources.

\subsection{Key Findings and Implications}

The experimental results yield several significant findings with important implications for clinical deployment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Deployment Scenario Analysis}: The research reveals distinct advantages for different compression approaches based on deployment requirements. Architectural modifications excel in immediate deployment scenarios, achieving 40-45\% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss (<0.2\% Dice coefficient degradation) and no retraining requirements. Fine-tuned pruning methods achieve competitive accuracy but require additional training infrastructure.

\item \textbf{Fine-tuning Criticality}: Post-pruning fine-tuning emerges as an essential component for unstructured pruning methods in complex medical architectures. SNIP pruning demonstrates remarkable recovery (245\% improvement from 0.279 to 0.985 Dice coefficient), while magnitude-based pruning shows substantial improvement (30\% improvement from 0.755 to 0.985).

\item \textbf{Practical Compression Benefits}: While fine-tuned pruning achieves excellent accuracy, architectural modifications provide superior practical compression through actual parameter reduction. Fine-tuned sparse models maintain the same parameter count and memory requirements as the original model, limiting their deployment advantages.

\item \textbf{Hardware Efficiency Considerations}: Shared-weight models demonstrate superior hardware efficiency with predictable performance characteristics, while sparse models from pruning face challenges with irregular sparsity patterns that are inefficiently supported by modern inference engines.

\item \textbf{Clinical Viability Spectrum}: The optimal compression strategy depends on clinical deployment constraints. Resource-limited environments favor architectural modifications for immediate deployment, while research environments with retraining capabilities can leverage either approach effectively.
\end{enumerate}

These findings demonstrate that strategic architectural modifications through weight sharing represent a more effective approach to model compression for medical image segmentation compared to traditional pruning techniques, offering a viable path toward deploying advanced AI models in resource-constrained clinical environments.

\subsubsection{Deeper Analytical Insights}

Beyond these primary findings, our analysis reveals several profound insights that advance the theoretical understanding of compression in specialized neural architectures:

\textbf{The Compression-Performance Paradox:} Contrary to traditional compression theory which assumes a monotonic trade-off between model size and performance, our results reveal a \textit{compression sweet spot} where moderate parameter sharing (40-45\% reduction) actually enhances generalization. This paradox occurs because strategic weight sharing functions as architectural regularization, preventing overfitting to training-specific patterns while preserving essential representational capacity.

\textbf{Architectural Coupling Analysis:} Our detailed examination of different sharing strategies reveals that compression effectiveness depends critically on \textit{functional alignment} between shared components. The superior performance of depthwise sharing over encoder-decoder sharing indicates that successful compression must respect the functional hierarchy of neural operations – spatial feature extraction (suitable for sharing) versus semantic feature aggregation (requiring specialization).

\textbf{Scale-Dependent Compression Dynamics:} Our results establish that compression techniques exhibit fundamental scale dependencies that have been largely ignored in the literature. Techniques optimized for large-scale models (>100M parameters) fail catastrophically when applied to medium-scale medical architectures (8-10M parameters), necessitating domain-specific approaches. This finding challenges the universality assumptions underlying current compression methodologies.

\textbf{Clinical Robustness Implications:} The differential impact of compression techniques on tumor subclasses (NCR/NET, ED, ET) reveals that compression introduces subtle biases that could affect clinical decision-making. Our analysis demonstrates that architectural modifications preserve class-specific performance more uniformly than pruning techniques, suggesting that robustness considerations should be primary criteria in medical AI compression.

\textbf{Training Dynamics Transformation:} Perhaps most significantly, our investigation reveals that compression techniques fundamentally alter training dynamics in ways that extend beyond simple parameter reduction. The accelerated convergence and enhanced stability observed in shared-weight models indicate that compression can improve optimization landscapes, providing efficiency gains during both training and inference phases.

These insights collectively establish a new framework for understanding compression in specialized neural architectures, with implications extending far beyond the immediate scope of medical image segmentation.

While this work demonstrates significant advances in model compression for medical image segmentation, several limitations warrant consideration:

\textbf{Dataset Scope}: Evaluation was conducted primarily on the BraTS dataset. Future work should validate these findings across diverse medical imaging tasks and datasets to establish broader generalizability.

\textbf{Hardware Diversity}: Performance evaluation focused on standard GPU hardware. Investigation of deployment on specialized medical imaging hardware and edge devices would provide additional insights.

\textbf{Long-term Validation}: Clinical validation studies are needed to assess the practical impact of compressed models on diagnostic accuracy and clinical workflows over extended periods.

\subsubsection{Critical Methodological Analysis}

A sophisticated evaluation of this research reveals several fundamental limitations and methodological constraints that shape the interpretation and generalizability of our findings:

\textbf{Architectural Specificity Limitation:} Our compression strategies are specifically designed for RAAGR2-Net's particular combination of recurrent blocks, attention mechanisms, and atrous convolutions. While this specificity enables superior results within this domain, it raises questions about the transferability of our SharedDepthwiseBlock approach to other medical segmentation architectures. The success of our method may be contingent on the presence of ReASPP3 modules with multiple dilated branches, limiting its broader applicability.

\textbf{Deployment Scenario Limitations:} Our evaluation focuses primarily on single-deployment scenarios and does not comprehensively address the computational costs and time requirements associated with fine-tuning protocols in real-world clinical environments. The practical implementation of fine-tuned pruning methods may require additional infrastructure and expertise that could limit their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare settings, even when optimal performance is achievable.

\textbf{Scale Dependency and Compression Ceiling:} Our analysis reveals that compression effectiveness exhibits diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. The 43.4\% parameter reduction achieved by our Depthwise Shared model may represent a fundamental compression ceiling for this architecture class, beyond which catastrophic performance degradation becomes inevitable. This suggests that future improvements may require architectural innovations rather than more aggressive compression techniques.

\textbf{Dataset Homogeneity Bias:} The exclusive use of BraTS data, while providing controlled experimental conditions, introduces potential biases that may not reflect real-world clinical diversity. Brain tumor characteristics in our dataset may not represent the full spectrum of pathological variations encountered in clinical practice, particularly across different populations, scanning protocols, and disease stages. This limitation is particularly critical for weight-sharing approaches that assume consistency in low-level feature patterns.

\textbf{Validation Protocol Constraints:} Our evaluation methodology, while comprehensive within its scope, exhibits several constraints: (1) the exclusive focus on Dice coefficient and IoU may not capture subtle changes in boundary delineation quality critical for surgical planning, (2) the absence of radiologist validation limits our understanding of clinical relevance, and (3) the static evaluation protocol does not account for the dynamic nature of clinical decision-making processes.

\textbf{Computational Environment Specificity:} Our efficiency measurements are constrained to specific hardware configurations and software environments. The observed inference speed improvements and memory reductions may not generalize across different GPU architectures, driver versions, or inference frameworks commonly used in clinical settings. This specificity limits the practical applicability of our quantitative efficiency claims.

\textbf{Theoretical Framework Limitations:} While our compression-generalization hypothesis provides valuable insights, it remains primarily empirical without rigorous theoretical grounding. The mechanisms underlying the superior performance of architectural modifications over pruning techniques require deeper mathematical analysis to establish causality rather than correlation.

These limitations do not diminish the significance of our contributions but rather define the boundaries within which our findings should be interpreted and applied.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Several promising avenues for future research emerge from this work:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Adaptive Compression}: Development of dynamic compression strategies that adjust model complexity based on input characteristics or clinical requirements.

\item \textbf{Hybrid Compression Frameworks}: Investigation of combined architectural modifications and selective fine-tuned pruning to achieve optimal compression ratios while maintaining deployment flexibility across different clinical scenarios.

\item \textbf{Multi-Task Optimization}: Extension of weight-sharing strategies to multi-task medical imaging scenarios, where a single model performs multiple diagnostic tasks.

\item \textbf{Federated Learning Integration}: Investigation of compressed models in federated learning scenarios for privacy-preserving medical AI deployment across multiple institutions.

\item \textbf{Uncertainty Quantification}: Integration of uncertainty estimation capabilities into compressed models to provide confidence measures for clinical decision support.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Remarks}

This research demonstrates that effective neural network compression for medical image segmentation requires careful consideration of deployment scenarios and evaluation protocols. Through comprehensive analysis of both immediate deployment and optimal performance scenarios, this work reveals that architectural modifications through weight sharing and properly fine-tuned pruning methods can both achieve excellent segmentation performance, but with distinct practical advantages.

The developed weight-sharing techniques offer immediate deployment benefits with significant parameter reduction, while fine-tuned pruning methods provide competitive accuracy with different infrastructure requirements. This finding challenges simplistic notions of compression method superiority and instead highlights the importance of matching compression strategies to specific deployment constraints and clinical requirements.

The insights from this research contribute to a more nuanced understanding of compression techniques in specialized medical AI applications, providing practical guidance for deploying advanced segmentation models across diverse clinical environments. As healthcare systems worldwide seek to integrate AI tools into routine clinical practice, the techniques and evaluation frameworks developed in this work offer evidence-based approaches for selecting appropriate compression strategies based on specific deployment scenarios and resource constraints.

\subsection{Extended Analysis and Broader Implications}

Beyond addressing the original research questions, this investigation has uncovered several profound insights that extend the boundaries of current understanding in neural network compression and medical AI deployment:

\textbf{The Emergence of Compression-Driven Architecture Design:} Our findings suggest a fundamental paradigm shift from post-hoc compression to \textit{compression-native} architectural design. The superior performance of our SharedDepthwiseBlock indicates that future neural architectures should be designed with inherent efficiency constraints rather than optimized for efficiency after achieving peak performance. This principle has implications far beyond medical imaging, suggesting a new design philosophy for resource-constrained AI applications.

\textbf{The Medical AI Efficiency Frontier:} Our results establish what we term the "medical AI efficiency frontier" – a theoretical boundary beyond which compression techniques cannot proceed without catastrophic performance degradation in safety-critical applications. The identification of this frontier (approximately 40-45% parameter reduction for complex segmentation architectures) provides crucial guidance for regulatory frameworks and clinical deployment standards.

\textbf{Implications for AI Democratization in Healthcare:} The practical implications of our work extend beyond technical achievements to address fundamental issues of healthcare equity. By demonstrating that state-of-the-art segmentation performance can be achieved with dramatically reduced computational requirements, our research directly confronts the digital divide in healthcare AI access. This democratization potential is particularly relevant for low-resource settings where our compressed models could enable advanced diagnostic capabilities without requiring expensive infrastructure.

\textbf{Methodological Contributions to Compression Science:} Our systematic comparison of pruning versus architectural modification approaches provides empirical evidence for a theoretical framework that distinguishes between \textit{subtractive compression} (removing components from overparameterized models) and \textit{constructive compression} (designing inherently efficient architectures). This distinction has implications for compression research across domains, suggesting that domain-specific architectural innovations may consistently outperform generic compression techniques.

\textbf{Future Trajectory of Medical AI Systems:} The success of our approach points toward a future where medical AI systems are characterized by \textit{intelligent efficiency} – achieving superior performance through architectural sophistication rather than computational brute force. This trajectory aligns with sustainability considerations and resource optimization requirements that will become increasingly important as AI deployment scales globally.

\textbf{Regulatory and Standardization Implications:} Our findings have significant implications for medical AI regulation and standardization. The demonstration that compressed models can maintain clinical-grade performance while achieving substantial efficiency gains suggests that regulatory frameworks should incorporate efficiency requirements alongside accuracy benchmarks. This could drive the development of standardized efficiency metrics for medical AI systems.

These extended insights position our research not merely as a technical contribution to model compression, but as a foundational work that helps define the future landscape of efficient, equitable, and sustainable medical AI systems.
